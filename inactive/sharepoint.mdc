# SHAREPOINT INTEGRATION

## Authentication and Access
- Use appropriate authentication method (app-based or user-based)
- Store credentials securely using environment variables
- Implement proper permission handling
- Document required permissions in README

## File Operations
- Implement retry logic for SharePoint API calls
- Cache file metadata to minimize API calls
- Document site IDs and library paths
- Handle file versioning appropriately
- Implement proper error handling for file operations

## Performance Considerations
- Use batch operations when possible
- Implement pagination for large file listings
- Cache frequently accessed files locally
- Use async operations for file uploads/downloads
- Monitor API usage and implement rate limiting
