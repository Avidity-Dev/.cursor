would you help me stage and commit my current changes appropriately following [git_best_practices.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/git_best_practices.mdc)? 

follow this procedure:
1) examine the changes with the following commands
    - `git status` to identify current state
    - `git diff --name-only | cat` to see which files changed
    - `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | cat` to see untracked files
2) make a suggestion for how to group the commits
    - identify logical categories that should be committed separately
3) stage and commit each group in sequence
