# Cursor Rules Directory

This directory contains rules and configurations for AI agents (primarily Cursor) to follow when working on projects.

## Directory Structure

### Rule Categories

- `document/` - Documentation standards and patterns
- `general/` - General coding and communication rules
- `git/` - Git workflow and commit conventions
- `linear/` - Linear issue tracking integration
- `modes/` - Different operational modes for the AI
- `projects/` - Project-specific rules and contexts
- `python/` - Python-specific coding standards
- `stack/` - Technology stack configurations
- `task-magic/` - Meta-rules for the Task Magic project management system
- `testing/` - Testing strategies and patterns
- `vibing/` - Creative and experimental rules

## Usage

When working with rules:

- Tag specific directories for domain-specific guidance: `@rules/python/`
- Tag `task-magic` when working with the project management system: `@rules/task-magic/`
- The AI will automatically discover and use relevant rules based on context
