# HCP-HCO Matching Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on converting an existing Python-based HCP-HCO matching algorithm into a production-ready Snowflake implementation using Snowpark. The system matches healthcare providers (HCPs) to healthcare organizations (HCOs) based on address data and affiliation information.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code for the application.
  - `@mastermind`: Core game logic and classes.
- `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests. See @pytest.ini for configuration.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for development, deployment, or data processing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
- `docs/`: Project documentation.
  - `@repository_structure`: Auto-generated file tree.
- `data/`: Data files used by the application (e.g., word lists, game history).
- `logs/`: Log files generated during application execution.
- `.dev/journal/` (SYM LINK): Learnings and guidelines extracted from development progress.
- `.cursor/` (SYM LINK): Configuration and rules for the Cursor AI assistant.
  - `@rules/`: Directory containing Cursor Rules.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies. @requirements.txt
- `setup.py`: Build script for the package. @setup.py
- `Makefile`: Common development commands. @Makefile
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions. @README.md

See `@docs/repository_structure.md` for a more detailed project structure.

## Project Objectives

1. Implement the existing Python algorithm using Snowpark's Python API
2. Enhance address geocoding using Mapbox integration
3. Implement robust error handling and validation
4. Create comprehensive monitoring and logging
5. Produce high-quality, maintainable code with documentation

## Domain-Specific Requirements

1. **Data Processing**
   - Maintain exact matching logic from original algorithm
   - Support the same hierarchy of match types
   - Preserve threshold values for geographical distance
   - Handle network affiliation rules correctly

2. **Technical Specifications**
   - Optimize for Snowflake performance using Snowpark's DataFrame API
   - Use Snowpark Python for data transformation and processing
   - Leverage Snowpark DataFrame operations for efficient data manipulation
   - Implement Haversine distance calculation as Snowpark UDFs
   - Support Mapbox integration for address validation
   - Maintain transaction integrity through Snowpark session management

3. **Output Requirements**
   - Primary affiliation table with matching reasons
   - Backup/debug tables for audit trails
   - HCO hierarchy resolution table

## Success Criteria

1. Results match the original Python implementation
2. Performance meets or exceeds original implementation
3. Error handling covers all edge cases
4. Documentation is comprehensive
5. Code follows best practices

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Technical Architecture
- Use Snowpark DataFrames for clear data transformation pipeline
- Design modular Python functions with well-defined inputs/outputs
- Implement temporary tables for intermediate processing
- Use permanent tables only for final outputs
- Apply proper schema design and naming conventions

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize DataFrame operations to leverage Snowflake's query optimizer
- Minimize data movement between Snowpark and Snowflake
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Implement efficient UDFs for custom logic

### Testing Strategy

- Validate against known test cases
- Compare outputs to original Python implementation
- Test with volume data to verify performance
- Validate edge cases and error handling
- Use pytest
