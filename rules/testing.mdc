# TESTING

- Adopt TDD with pytest (no unittest module)
- Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Use mocks & fixtures for isolated testing
- Run tests in continuous integration
- Fully annotate tests with docstrings
- Place tests in ./tests directory with __init__.py as needed

## Test Structure
- Test files should be named test_*.py
- Test functions should be named test_*
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests in classes when appropriate
- Use fixtures for common setup and teardown
- Use parametrized tests for testing multiple inputs

## Test Coverage
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Include regression tests for fixed bugs
