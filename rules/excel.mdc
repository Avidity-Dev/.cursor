# EXCEL PROCESSING

## File Handling
- Use openpyxl for Excel file manipulation
- Implement robust error handling for malformed Excel files
- Document expected Excel formats and schemas
- Handle both .xls and .xlsx formats appropriately
- Implement proper file locking during operations

## Data Extraction
- Validate data before processing
- Use pandas for data transformation and cleaning
- Maintain column mapping documentation
- Handle missing or malformed data gracefully
- Implement data type validation and conversion

## Performance Considerations
- Use streaming for large Excel files
- Implement memory-efficient processing
- Cache processed data when appropriate
- Use batch processing for multiple files
- Monitor and log processing times
