# Linear Guide - Document Purpose and Writing Approach

## Purpose
The [Linear Guide](mdc:Linear Guide) is an onboarding document for external contractors who currently use Jira but will be working with us in Linear. This is NOT primarily a migration guide, but rather a resource to help Jira-experienced users quickly become comfortable and productive in Linear for our new project.

## Document Structure
1. Welcome and introduction to Linear's philosophy
2. Practical crash course focused on daily workflows
3. Translation of Jira concepts to Linear equivalents
4. Project-specific setup and productivity tips
5. Appendices with additional resources and optional migration information

## Writing Considerations
- Tone: Friendly, confident, and reassuring for users uncomfortable with changing tools
- Focus: Practical over theoretical, emphasizing what contractors need to know immediately
- Format: Concise explanations with bullet points and tables for easy scanning
- Context: Written with the understanding that contractors already know Jira but don't need to migrate existing projects
- Migration info: Included as a bonus (Appendix B) should contractors want to use Linear for their own projects in the future

## Key Sections
- "Welcome! Working with Us in Linear": Establishes why we use Linear and its core principles
- "Getting Started Quickly": Focuses on key concepts and workflows they'll use daily
- "Bridging the Gap": Directly addresses translation from Jira concepts to Linear
- "Practical Setup & Tips": Specific to our team's implementation of Linear
- Optional appendices for additional learning and reference

## Development Status
This document is currently under development, with sections being revised and expanded to better serve our specific audience of contractors transitioning from Jira to Linear for our projects.
