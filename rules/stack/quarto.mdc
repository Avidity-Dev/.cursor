# Understanding `.qmd` (Quarto) Files

## Quarto Overview

Quarto is a scientific and technical publishing system that uses markdown enhanced with embedded code blocks. It allows for **reproducible documents**, **data visualization**, and **interactive analysis**, often used with R, Python, or Julia.

## Structure of `.qmd` Files

### 1. YAML Front Matter (optional)

```yaml
---
title: "My Analysis"
author: "Data Wizard"
format: html
---
```

Defines document-level metadata like title, author, and output format.

### 2. Markdown Text

Regular markdown is used for narrative content:

```markdown
## Introduction
This document explores the deep mysteries of the dataset.
```

### 3. Code Cells / Chunks

Executable blocks in supported languages (typically R, Python):

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

or with metadata:

```{python}
#| label: calculate-mean
df.mean()
```

- `#| label:` provides a label for the code cell (often used for referencing or documentation).
- Inline code is supported using backticks: `` `r 2 + 2` ``

### 4. Comments and Explanatory Notes

Markdown text can appear between code blocks to describe logic, rationale, or results.

### 5. Output from Code

Code outputs (e.g., tables, plots, lists) appear **beneath** the corresponding code block. These are part of the rendered result and should be associated with the block above.

## Reading `.qmd` Files

To interpret a Quarto file:

- Detect **code blocks** by triple backticks and `{language}` markers.
- Capture **labels and metadata** using the `#|` syntax inside code chunks.
- Treat all non-code as **narrative markdown** or commentary.
- Associate **outputs with the code block** directly above them.
- Read the **YAML front matter** to understand document settings and rendering preferences.

## Additional Notes

- `.qmd` files can be rendered to formats like **HTML, PDF, and slides**.
- Code inside blocks is **executed**, and the output is embedded in the final document.
- Think of `.qmd` as a hybrid of Markdown, R Markdown, and Jupyter Notebooks.
