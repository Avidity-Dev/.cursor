# CODE STYLE AND STRUCTURE

- Write concise, technical Python code in OOP style
- Prefer iteration & modularization over duplication
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., isLoading)
- Follow repository structure as defined in project documentation

# CODE QUALITY

- Follow PEP 8 for Python
- Use linters and formatters (pylint, black)
- Regular code reviews and pair programming
- Secure authentication, encryption, and vulnerability protection
- Optimize performance with efficient algorithms, caching, and query optimization

# CODE SNIPPET & FILE CREATION RULES

- ALWAYS add typing annotations to functions and classes
- Include return types as needed
- Update existing docstrings if needed
- Preserve existing comments
- Use absolute imports where possible
- Use only pytest for tests
- Place tests in ./tests with typed test functions and docstrings
