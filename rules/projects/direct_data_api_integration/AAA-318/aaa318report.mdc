## 1. Project Overview

This report tracks the progress for **Phase 2** of the Veeva CRM Direct Data API integration project (PRJ_018). This phase, corresponding to Linear task **AAA-318**, focuses on creating a Dagster asset to unpack `.tar.gz` archives received from Veeva (via the Phase 1 asset), perform minimal cleanup on the constituent files (primarily CSVs), and store these individual files in a "processed" or "unpacked" location within Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).

The primary goal is to make the raw Veeva data accessible for subsequent processing stages by implementing a robust unpacking mechanism. Extensive data validation and transformation are out of scope for this phase.

## 2. Project Phases & Milestones

### 2.1. Phase 2: Veeva CRM Archive Unpacking & Basic File Preparation (AAA-318)
*   **Summary**: Develop a Dagster asset to download, unpack, and perform basic preparation of Veeva CRM `.tar.gz` archives from ADLS, storing extracted CSVs in a new ADLS location.
*   **Linear Task**: [AAA-318](https://linear.app/avidml/issue/AAA-318/veeva-crm-direct-data-zip-unpacking-and-cleanup-asset)
*   **Planned Start Date**: 2025-05-14
*   **Actual Start Date**: 2025-05-14
*   **Planned End Date**: 2025-05-16
*   **Actual End Date**: 2025-05-16
*   **Status**: Completed

## 3. Implementation Status

Tasks derived from PRD Section 5: "Implementation Tasks".

*   **Task:** [Task ID 1] Create `prometheus/veeva/archive.py` (unpacking & filtering logic)
    **Status:** Completed
    **Notes:** `unpack_and_stream_tar_gz_members` and `filter_csv_files_from_stream` functions have been implemented to handle streaming of archive contents. `extract_csv_streams` was also added as a convenience function. Unit tests in `tests/veeva/test_archive.py` have been created and passed successfully, confirming the functionality. The decision to use the existing `metadata.csv` file within the archive was made, and thus, logic for generating a `metadata.json` file was removed.

*   **Task:** [Task ID 2] Update/Define Dagster Resources for "unpacked" ADLS location
    **Status:** Completed
    **Notes:** `VeevaCRMVaultAdlsStorageResource` is reused with different configuration for the "unpacked" location. `AzureStorageResource` in `prometheus/veeva/resources.py` and `prometheus/veeva/definitions.py` updated to reflect this.

*   **Task:** [Task ID 3] Implement `unpacked_tarball` Asset in `assets.py` (formerly `veeva_crm_vault_unpacked_files_to_adls`)
    **Status:** Completed
    **Notes:** Asset implementation finalized in `prometheus/veeva/assets.py` as `unpacked_tarball`. It uses `direct_data_api_tarball` as input. Added `compute_kind` and `MaterializeResult` for improved Dagster observability; updated function signature to use the appropriate storage resource; maintained use of `build_unpacked_blob_name` from `prometheus/veeva/utils.py` for target path construction. `prometheus/veeva/blob_helpers.py` was created to assist with ADLS operations.

*   **Task:** [Task ID 4] Configuration: Update Dagster definitions, ensure env vars.
    **Status:** Completed
    **Notes:** All necessary configurations for the new asset and resources are in place in `prometheus/veeva/definitions.py`. Environment variables `VAULT_DOMAIN`, `VAULT_USERNAME`, `VAULT_PASSWORD`, `AZURE_BLOB_STORE_CONNECTION_STRING`, `ADLS_CONTAINER_NAME`, and `ADLS_TARGET_PATH_PREFIX` are documented and utilized.

*   **Task:** [Task ID 5] Testing: Unit tests (Task 1), Local asset tests, End-to-end tests.
    **Status:** Completed
    **Notes:** Unit tests for `archive.py` (`tests/veeva/test_archive.py`), `utils.py` (`tests/veeva/test_utils.py`), and the `direct_data_api_tarball` & `unpacked_tarball` assets (`tests/veeva/test_assets.py`) have been created and pass locally. Addressed string literal formatting, stubbed azure.blob to avoid import errors, fixed `AssetIn` usage, and enabled pytest_asyncio plugin. Successfully resolved several issues in `tests/veeva/test_assets.py` related to Dagster's direct asset invocation for testing: corrected context creation using `build_op_context`, ensured proper resource key matching and provision, handled Dagster `MetadataValue` objects correctly by accessing their `.value` attribute, and fixed `Output` constructor usage. All unit tests in `tests/veeva/` now pass. End-to-end tests for the Dagster assets were successfully run, verifying files in the "unpacked" ADLS location.
    
*   **Task:** [Task ID 6] Documentation: Docstrings, PRD updates
    **Status:** Completed
    **Notes:** Docstrings added to `prometheus/veeva/api.py`, `prometheus/veeva/archive.py`, `prometheus/veeva/assets.py`, `prometheus/veeva/blob_helpers.py`, `prometheus/veeva/resources.py`, `prometheus/veeva/utils.py` and all corresponding test files. PRD updated with resource name changes, ADLS path clarifications, env var configuration details, and refined implementation tasks. The `docs/repository_structure.md` file will be updated by running the `tree` command.

| 2025-05-14 | Task ID 1          | `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file` | File streams closed before content was read     | Updated tests to read content immediately        | Ensure stream handling in tests accounts for context managers |
| 2025-05-15 | Task ID 5          | ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aioboto3' | Attempt to import `AzureBlobStore` in tests      | Stubbed `prometheus.azure.blob` module to bypass missing dependency | Add test-specific stubbing or include `aioboto3` in dev dependencies |
| 2025-05-15 | Task ID 5          | TypeError: AssetIn.__new__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'asset_key' | Incorrect `AssetIn` API usage                          | Corrected `AssetIn` instantiation to use positional `AssetKey` argument    | Review Dagster API signatures for correct usage           |
| 2025-05-15 | Task ID 5          | Unterminated string literal in test for `csv_data` | Multiline byte string incorrectly formatted            | Updated `csv_data` to use `\n` escape sequences                          | Validate string literals and formatting in tests           |
| 2025-05-15 | Task ID 5          | Async tests skipped: missing pytest_asyncio plugin     | `pytest_asyncio` plugin not enabled                     | Added `pytest_plugins = ("pytest_asyncio",)` to test file                  | Configure pytest to include `pytest_asyncio` plugin       |
| 2025-05-15 | Task ID 5          | `DagsterInvalidInvocationError`: `DummyContext` not valid for asset invocation.       | `DummyContext` didn't inherit from Dagster's execution context. Direct asset invocation requires a context created by Dagster utilities.            | Replaced `DummyContext()` with `build_op_context()` from `dagster._core.execution.context.invocation` to create a valid testing context.                                                                        | Always use `build_op_context` or similar Dagster-provided utilities for creating context in unit/integration tests invoking assets/ops directly. |
| 2025-05-15 | Task ID 5          | `DagsterInvalidInvocationError`: Cannot provide resources in both context and kwargs. | Resource was provided to `build_op_context` AND passed as a direct argument to the asset function. Dagster expects resources from one source.     | Removed the resource argument from the direct asset call, relying on the context (created with `build_op_context`) to provide it.                                                                           | When using `build_op_context` with resources, do not pass those same resources as direct arguments to the asset/op. |
| 2025-05-15 | Task ID 5          | `DagsterInvalidDefinitionError`: Required resource key mismatch.                    | The key used for the resource in `build_op_context` did not match the key expected by the asset definition (`veeva_crm_vault_adls_unpacked_storage`). | Updated the key in `build_op_context(resources={...})` to `veeva_crm_vault_adls_unpacked_storage` to match the asset's requirement.                                                                       | Ensure resource keys provided in test contexts exactly match the keys defined and expected by the asset/op.     |
| 2025-05-15 | Task ID 5          | `AttributeError`: `'TextMetadataValue' object has no attribute 'replace'`.        | Metadata from upstream `Output` objects are Dagster `MetadataValue` types, not raw strings. String methods can't be called directly.            | Accessed the `.value` attribute of the `TextMetadataValue` objects (e.g., `source_metadata["source_filename"].value`) to get the actual string before calling `.replace()`.                                   | Always access the `.value` (or `.text`) attribute of Dagster `MetadataValue` objects before treating them as simple strings. |
| 2025-05-15 | Task ID 5          | `TypeError`: `Output.__init__()` got unexpected keyword `asset_key`.                | `dagster.Output` constructor does not accept `asset_key` or `asset_materialization`. These are handled differently (e.g., via `context.log_event`). | Removed `asset_key` and `asset_materialization` kwargs from the `Output()` call at the end of the asset. Ensured `AssetMaterialization` was logged via `context.log_event()`.                               | Refer to Dagster documentation for correct `Output` constructor parameters. Use `context.log_event` for `AssetMaterialization`. |
| 2025-05-16 | Task ID 3, 5       | Asset `unpacked_tarball` logic for ADLS paths and streaming refined.             | Initial implementation needed adjustments for correct path construction with `build_unpacked_blob_name` and robust streaming from `unpack_and_stream_tar_gz_members`. | Corrected path logic in `unpacked_tarball` to align with `build_unpacked_blob_name` from `utils.py`. Ensured stream handling was robust. | Thoroughly test path generation and stream handling logic in assets. |
| 2025-05-16 | Task ID 4          | Resource configuration in `definitions.py` needed to align with asset requirements. | Resource keys and configurations in `prometheus/veeva/definitions.py` required updates to match resource usage in assets. | Ensured `veeva_crm_vault_api` and `veeva_crm_vault_adls_storage` resources were correctly defined and passed to assets. | Double-check resource definitions against asset requirements during integration. |

## 5. Design Decisions

Key design decisions are detailed in the [PRD Section 4: Technical Approach](./prj18_prd_aaa318.md#4-technical-approach). Summary:

1.  **Asset Structure**: Two main Dagster assets: `direct_data_api_tarball` (Phase 1, fetches archive to raw ADLS) and `unpacked_tarball` (Phase 2, unpacks archive from raw to processed ADLS location). `unpacked_tarball` depends on `direct_data_api_tarball`.
2.  **Archive Handling Module**: `prometheus/veeva/archive.py` encapsulates `.tar.gz` unpacking logic (e.g., `unpack_and_stream_tar_gz_members`, `extract_csv_streams`).
3.  **Processing Strategy**: Archives are downloaded from ADLS (raw zone) to an in-memory buffer. `unpacked_tarball` then streams members from this buffer and uploads them to a "processed" prefix in ADLS.
4.  **ADLS Interaction**: Utilizes `AzureBlobStore` client from `prometheus/azure/blob.py`, wrapped by helper functions in `prometheus/veeva/blob_helpers.py`.
5.  **Dagster Resources**: Reuses `AzureStorageResource` (from `prometheus/veeva/resources.py`) with different configurations for raw and processed data ADLS locations. `VeevaCRMVaultAPIResource` handles Veeva API interaction.
6.  **Output Path**: Unpacked files are stored in ADLS with a path structure: `[target_path_prefix]/unpacked_[archive_name_without_ext]/[member_name]`. Path construction is centralized using `build_unpacked_blob_name` from `prometheus/veeva/utils.py`.
7.  **Metadata Handling**: The `direct_data_api_tarball` asset outputs metadata including the ADLS URL of the raw archive. The `unpacked_tarball` asset generates `MaterializeResult` with metadata about unpacked files.

## 6. Technical Insights

Refer to PRD Sections [3.2. Out of Scope](./prj18_prd_aaa318.md#32-out-of-scope) and [7. Key Dependencies & Assumptions](./prj18_prd_aaa318.md#7-key-dependencies--assumptions).

*   **Dependencies**:
    *   Python `tarfile`, `io`, `mimetypes`, `os.path`, `urllib.parse` modules.
    *   `prometheus/azure/blob.py` (`AzureBlobStore`).
    *   Dagster core libraries.
    *   `prometheus/veeva/api.py` (`VeevaClient`, `get_veeva_session`).
    *   `prometheus/veeva/archive.py` (`unpack_and_stream_tar_gz_members`, `extract_csv_streams`).
    *   `prometheus/veeva/utils.py` (`build_unpacked_blob_name`, `parse_adls_url`, `build_member_metadata`, `guess_mime_type`).
    *   `prometheus/veeva/resources.py` (`AzureStorageResource`, `VeevaCRMVaultAPIResource`).
    *   `prometheus/veeva/blob_helpers.py` (`download_file_stream`, `upload_file_get_url`).
    *   `httpx` for asynchronous HTTP requests.
*   **Assumptions**:
    *   Input archives are `.tar.gz`, located at an ADLS path configured via an `AzureStorageResource` instance (e.g., `landing/internal/veeva/crm/`).
    *   ADLS connection string (`AZURE_BLOB_STORE_CONNECTION_STRING`) and container name (`ADLS_CONTAINER_NAME`), along with Veeva credentials (`VAULT_DOMAIN`, `VAULT_USERNAME`, `VAULT_PASSWORD`) and path prefix (`ADLS_TARGET_PATH_PREFIX`) are available via environment variables and configured in Dagster resources.
    *   Permissions for ADLS read (raw location) and write (processed location) are in place.
    *   The `direct_data_api_tarball` asset is functional and provides its output (ADLS URL of the tarball) correctly.
    *   Archive and constituent file sizes are manageable for in-memory processing (via streaming for members).
*   **Limitations/Constraints**:
    *   No complex data validation or transformation in this phase.
    *   Only `.tar.gz` archives are supported.
    *   No incremental processing within an archive.
    *   Manual/dependency-based triggering; specific scheduling is deferred.
