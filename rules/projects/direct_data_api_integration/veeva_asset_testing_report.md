# Veeva Dagster Asset Testing Report

**Date:** 2025-05-17 (Updated)

## 1. Purpose

This report summarizes the efforts to create a robust suite of unit tests for two Veeva Dagster assets:

1.  `direct_data_api_tarball`: Fetches a `.tar.gz` export from the Veeva API and uploads it to a "raw" zone in Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).
2.  `unpacked_tarball`: Downloads the archive from ADLS, unpacks it, filters for CSVs, and uploads these individual files to a "processed" zone in ADLS.

The primary goal is to enable thorough testing of the assets' logic without requiring a running Dagster server or actual external service interactions, with a particular focus on correct metadata handling and leveraging Dagster's testing utilities.

## 2. Changes Implemented (Focus on `test_unpacked_asset.py`)

Over the course of this session, the following key changes and iterations were made, culminating in a significant refactor based on Dagster best practices:

1.  **Initial Challenge & Custom Context (`MinimalAssetContext`):**
    *   The initial primary blocker was `AttributeError: property 'asset_key' of 'DirectAssetExecutionContext' object has no setter` when using `build_asset_context` and attempting manual `asset_key` assignment.
    *   This led to the creation of a custom `MinimalAssetContext` class, which was iteratively refined by adding mock methods (`bind`, `unbind`, `for_type`) and attributes (`per_invocation_properties`) to satisfy Dagster's internal invocation machinery. This allowed tests to progress further but was a workaround for deeper issues.

2.  **Refactor to Dagster Best Practices (based on external advice and documentation):**
    *   **Asset-Side Change (`prometheus/veeva/assets.py`):**
        *   The `unpacked_tarball` asset was modified to return `dagster.MaterializeResult` instead of `dagster.Output`.
        *   Metadata is now directly included in `MaterializeResult`, and complex metadata (like lists of dicts) is wrapped with `dagster.MetadataValue.json()`.
        *   The explicit `context.log_event(AssetMaterialization(...))` call was removed, as `MaterializeResult` handles this implicitly.
    *   **Test-Side Changes (`tests/veeva/test_unpacked_asset.py`):**
        *   The custom `MinimalAssetContext` class was **removed entirely**.
        *   The `unpacked_asset_context` pytest fixture was refactored to use `dagster.build_asset_context()` directly.
        *   The `resources` argument for `build_asset_context` is now a direct dictionary of resource instances (`resource_instances`), resolving the `ParameterCheckError: Param "resources" is not one of ['Mapping']` that occurred when `build_resources` was used in a way that yielded a `_ScopedResources` object.
        *   Test function signatures were updated to expect `dagster.AssetExecutionContext`.
        *   Assertions in tests were updated to check the properties of the `MaterializeResult` object (e.g., `result.value`, `result.metadata`).
        *   A `SyntaxWarning` for an invalid escape sequence in a regex for `pytest.raises` was corrected by using a raw string (`r"..."`).

3.  **Diagnostic Steps During `MinimalAssetContext` Phase:**
    *   An assertion `unpacked_asset_context.instance.get_latest_materialization_event.assert_called_once_with(...)` was added and passed, confirming that the mock for retrieving upstream materialization events was being called correctly, even when the asset logic subsequently failed to find the event.

4.  **Environment and Dependencies:**
    *   Ensured the Python virtual environment was active.
    *   Installed `pytest-cov`.

## 3. Current Status (Post-Refactor to `build_asset_context` and `MaterializeResult`)

*   **Asset Code (`prometheus/veeva/assets.py`):** Updated to use `MaterializeResult`.
*   **Test Code (`tests/veeva/test_unpacked_asset.py`):** Significantly simplified. `MinimalAssetContext` is removed. The `unpacked_asset_context` fixture now correctly uses `build_asset_context` with a dictionary of resource instances. Assertions are updated for `MaterializeResult`.

*   **Expected Outcome of Next Test Run:**
    *   The `ParameterCheckError` related to `_ScopedResources` should be resolved due to the corrected `unpacked_asset_context` fixture.
    *   The tests should now more accurately reflect idiomatic Dagster testing patterns.
    *   It remains to be seen if the previous `RuntimeError: No materialization event found for upstream asset...` persists. If it does, the issue is likely very specific to how `mock_dagster_instance.get_latest_materialization_event.return_value` is being perceived by the asset logic within the context created by `build_asset_context`.

*   **Other Test Files:**
    *   Status of `tests/veeva/test_tarball_asset.py` is pending application of similar modernizations (using `MaterializeResult` in the asset and `build_asset_context` in tests).
    *   Failures in `tests/veeva/test_transformer.py` (pre-existing) are still outstanding.

## 4. Plan to Fix Remaining Issues

1.  **Run Tests for `test_unpacked_asset.py`:** Execute the tests with the latest user-applied changes to confirm the `ParameterCheckError` is gone and to see the new state of the tests.
2.  **Analyze Failures (If Any):**
    *   If the `RuntimeError: No materialization event found...` persists, the focus will be on the interaction between `mock_dagster_instance.get_latest_materialization_event` (as part of the context built by `build_asset_context`) and the asset's logic.
    *   Verify the structure and attributes of the `mock_event` returned by `_get_mock_materialization_event` are correctly interpreted when accessed via `context.instance` where `context` is a `DirectAssetExecutionContext` (the type returned by `build_asset_context`).
3.  **Refactor `test_tarball_asset.py`:**
    *   Modify the `direct_data_api_tarball` asset to return `MaterializeResult`.
    *   Update tests in `tests/veeva/test_tarball_asset.py` to use `build_asset_context` and assert against `MaterializeResult`.

## 5. Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  Execute `pytest` for `tests/veeva/test_unpacked_asset.py` to observe the results of the recent refactoring.

## 6. Error Log and Solutions

This section maintains a chronological log of errors encountered and their solutions, which serves as a reference for future debugging.

### 6.1 Initial Error: AttributeError for asset_key

**Error:**
```
AttributeError: property 'asset_key' of 'DirectAssetExecutionContext' object has no setter
```

**Context:** 
This occurred when attempting to use `build_asset_context()` and then manually setting its `asset_key` property.

**Solution (Initial):** 
Created a custom `MinimalAssetContext` class that manually includes properly mocked properties and methods required by the Dagster asset invocation machinery.

### 6.2 Missing bind Method

**Error:**
```
AttributeError: 'MinimalAssetContext' object has no attribute 'bind'
```

**Context:**
The asset invocation machinery expected a `bind` method on the context.

**Solution:**
Added a no-op `bind` method to `MinimalAssetContext` that returned `self`.

### 6.3 Missing unbind Method

**Error:**
```
AttributeError: 'MinimalAssetContext' object has no attribute 'unbind'
```

**Context:**
After the `bind` method was called, the asset invocation machinery expected an `unbind` method.

**Solution:**
Added a no-op `unbind` method to `MinimalAssetContext`.

### 6.4 Missing per_invocation_properties

**Error:**
```
AttributeError: 'MinimalAssetContext' object has no attribute 'per_invocation_properties'
```

**Context:**
The asset invocation machinery expected a `per_invocation_properties` attribute.

**Solution:**
Added a mock `per_invocation_properties` attribute to `MinimalAssetContext`:
```python
self.per_invocation_properties = MagicMock(spec=PerInvocationProperties)
```

### 6.5 Missing for_type Method

**Error:**
```
AttributeError: 'MinimalAssetContext' object has no attribute 'for_type'
```

**Context:**
Asset type checking in Dagster expected a `for_type` method.

**Solution:**
Added a mock `for_type` method to `MinimalAssetContext` that returned `self`.

### 6.6 RuntimeError for Missing Materialization Event

**Error:**
```
RuntimeError: No materialization event found for upstream asset
```

**Context:**
Despite mocking `get_latest_materialization_event`, the asset still couldn't find the materialization event.

**Solution (Partial):**
Added an assertion to verify the mock was being called correctly:
```python
unpacked_asset_context.instance.get_latest_materialization_event.assert_called_once_with(
    AssetKey("direct_data_api_tarball")
)
```
The assertion passed, confirming the method was being called with the correct asset key, but the issue persisted with how the event was being processed.

### 6.7 Refactoring to Best Practices

After multiple iterations of adding mock methods and attributes to `MinimalAssetContext`, we received advice through ChatGPT highlighting Dagster best practices:

**Key Insights:**
1. Use `MaterializeResult` instead of manually creating `Output` and `AssetMaterialization`.
2. Use `build_asset_context` properly with a dictionary (not a `_ScopedResources` object).
3. Consider the `with_resources` pattern for dependency injection without a context for even simpler tests.

**Implementation Changes:**
1. Asset now returns `MaterializeResult`.
2. MinimalAssetContext class completely removed.
3. `unpacked_asset_context` fixture updated to use `build_asset_context` correctly.

### 6.8 ParameterCheckError for Resources Type

**Error:**
```
dagster_shared.check.CheckError: ParameterCheckError: Param "resources" is not one of ['Mapping']
```

**Context:**
When using `build_asset_context`, the `resources` parameter expected a mapping/dictionary, but got a `_ScopedResources` object.

**Solution:**
Ensured the resources were passed as a direct dictionary, not through the result of `build_resources`.

## 7. Lessons Learned

1. **Dagster Best Practices:**
   * Use `MaterializeResult` for assets rather than manually creating `Output` and `AssetMaterialization`.
   * Rely on Dagster's built-in utilities like `build_asset_context` instead of creating custom context objects.

2. **Testing Patterns:**
   * Mocking Dagster internals is complex; prefer using the officially supported testing utilities.
   * When testing assets, focus on the asset logic rather than Dagster implementation details.

3. **ResourcefulContext Understanding:**
   * The context returned by `build_asset_context` already handles resource binding and many internal Dagster mechanisms.
   * Understand the difference between a resource dictionary and a `_ScopedResources` object when working with context builders.

4. **Metadata Handling:**
   * Use `MetadataValue.json()` for complex data (dicts, lists).
   * Understand the distinction between `MaterializeResult.value` (the actual return value) and `MaterializeResult.metadata` (metadata associated with the materialization).

## 8. Future Work

1. Apply the same modernization patterns to `tests/veeva/test_tarball_asset.py` by:
   * Updating the asset to return `MaterializeResult`.
   * Replacing any custom context with `build_asset_context`.

2. Investigate and fix failures in `tests/veeva/test_transformer.py`.

3. Consider further refactoring to the test methods themselves:
   * Potentially implement the context-less pattern using `asset_def.with_resources({...})` for simpler tests that don't require mocking the context.
   * Improve test parameterization to cover more edge cases efficiently.
