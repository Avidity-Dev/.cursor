# BENCHLING INTEGRATION SPECIFICS

## API Usage
- Always use the benchling-sdk package for API interactions
    - The sdk docs are indexed should be included with relevant queries by including `@Benchling Python SDK` in the query
- Store API credentials securely using environment variables
- Implement proper rate limiting and error handling for API calls
- Cache frequently accessed Benchling data when appropriate
- Use entity IDs from the appropriate environment (dev/prod)

## Entity Management
- Follow Benchling's entity relationship model
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across entities
- Document schema IDs and folder IDs in resources/api_ids directory
- Implement validation for required fields before entity creation

## Benchling Data Models
- Create proper data models for Benchling entities
- Use type hints for all entity properties
- Implement serialization/deserialization methods
- Validate data before sending to Benchling API
- Handle API version changes gracefully
