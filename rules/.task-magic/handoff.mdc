# Task Magic: Handoffs

## 1. Purpose

Handoff files are designed to ensure smooth context transfer between AI assistant sessions or threads when working on a specific task within the Task Magic system. They provide a concise summary of the current status, key findings, immediate next steps, and relevant files for a task, allowing a new AI instance to quickly understand the context and continue productively.

This complements project-level reports by providing a more granular, task-focused snapshot suitable for operational continuity.

## 2. Location and Naming Convention

-   **Directory**: All handoff files are stored in the `.ai/handoffs/` directory at the root of the workspace.
-   **File Naming**: Handoff files should be named according to the task they pertain to, with an optional iteration number if multiple handoffs are generated for the same task.
    -   Format: `task{id}_handoff{iteration}.md`
    -   Example: `task6_handoff1.md`, `task12_handoff2.md`
    -   If it's the first handoff for a task, `_handoff1` can be omitted for simplicity (e.g., `task6_handoff.md`), but including the iteration is preferred for clarity if multiple handoffs are anticipated.

## 3. Content Guidelines

A handoff file should be a Markdown document (`.md`) and typically include:

-   **Project Context**: Briefly state the overall project and the specific feature/task being worked on.
-   **Current Situation & Key Findings**:
    -   Overall status of the task (e.g., In Progress, Blocked).
    -   Priority.
    -   Summary of major accomplishments so far.
    -   Detailed explanation of any current issues, blockers, or specific problems being debugged.
    -   Key discoveries or insights gained.
-   **Immediate Next Actions & Goal**:
    -   Clearly define the most critical next step(s).
    -   Outline the strategy for tackling these steps.
    -   State the immediate goal for the next work session.
-   **Key Files**: List all relevant files, including:
    -   Main script(s) being worked on.
    -   Debug logs.
    -   Relevant data or test files.
    -   Associated task file (e.g., `.ai/tasks/task{id}_...md`).
    -   Associated PRD file (e.g., `.ai/plans/features/...-plan.md`).
-   **Success Criteria for Next Phase**: What defines success for the immediate next actions.
-   **(Optional) Relevant Documentation/Links**: Pointers to any critical documentation that was recently consulted or is highly relevant.

## 4. When to Create/Update

-   When switching between AI chat threads/sessions.
-   Before ending a work session if the task is not complete.
-   When a significant sub-goal within a task is achieved and new context needs to be set.
-   When explicitly requested by the user (e.g., by asking to "create a handoff").

## 5. Integration with Task Magic System

-   This handoff mechanism is a component of the Task Magic system.
-   It should be used in conjunction with the main task files in `.ai/tasks/` and plan files in `.ai/plans/`.
-   The handoff file provides an operational "state snapshot," while the task file tracks the overall task lifecycle and the plan file describes the feature requirements.

**Fetching this Rule**:
- Use `@handoff.mdc` or `task-magic/handoff.mdc` when needing to understand handoff procedures.
