# DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

- Use proper Git with semantic versioning for releases
- Implement robust code review processes
- Maintain a clear changelog
- Follow branch naming conventions
- Use feature branches for development

## Git Workflow
- Use feature branches for new features
- Use bugfix branches for bug fixes
- Create pull requests for code review
- Squash commits before merging
- Write descriptive commit messages

## Code Review
- Review code for correctness, style, and performance
- Use automated code quality tools
- Document review decisions
- Address all review comments
- Verify tests pass before merging

# ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

- SOLID principles
- Clean Architecture
- Layered architecture (presentation, business logic, data access)
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- API-first design for scalability
- Event-driven architecture when appropriate

## Design Patterns
- Use appropriate design patterns for common problems
- Document pattern usage and rationale
- Avoid over-engineering
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use interfaces for abstraction
