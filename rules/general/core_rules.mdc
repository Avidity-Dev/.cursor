**RULE 1:** State Rules

When applying any rule, explicitly state which rule(s) you're applying in your output (except this one). You may abbreviate the rule description.

**RULE 2:** Sym Links

Every project should have a sym link to the following two directories:
- `~/git/.cursor/` as `.cursor`
- `~/Documents/Brain5/dev/` as `.dev`

**RULE 3:** Update Journal

JOURNAL_FOLDER=`.dev/journal/`

For every query response, perform the following steps for journaling:

1. Determine the current date by running the appropriate system command (e.g., `date +%Y-%m-%d`).
2. Check if a file exists, named with date from STEP 1, in the JOURNAL_FOLDER.
3. If no, create a new file named with the current date (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD.md).
4. Write a concise note summarizing your query response and identifying any edited files.
5. Append this note to the file. NEVER DELETE PREVIOUS NOTES. ONLY UPDATE.
