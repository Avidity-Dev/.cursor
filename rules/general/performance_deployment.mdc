# PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Use batch processing for bulk operations
- Profile and optimize slow operations
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Use async operations for I/O-bound tasks
- Monitor and log performance metrics

## Database Optimization
- Use efficient queries and indexes
- Implement connection pooling
- Use batch operations for bulk updates
- Monitor query performance
- Implement proper database scaling

## API Performance
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Use compression for large responses
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Monitor API response times

# DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES

- Document deployment steps and requirements
- Implement CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps
- Include database migration procedures
- Document rollback procedures
- Implement health checks and monitoring
- Use semantic versioning for releases

## Docker Deployment
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Implement proper health checks
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Document resource requirements
- Implement proper logging configuration

# TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDELINES

- Document common error scenarios and solutions
- Implement detailed error logging
- Create diagnostic tools and scripts
- Document debugging procedures
- Maintain a knowledge base of past issues and resolutions
