# Collaboration Strategy
Guidelines for effective AI-human collaboration across all projects

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1. Documentation First
- Always document before implementing any code. Articulate the feature we are building or the problem we are solving.
- Write clear explanations of your reasoning when you've decided on a design or a solution.
- When writing code, always add in line comments to explain what the code is doing.
- Update docs when implementation changes
- Write progress reports as the central documents for tracking all project progress (see guidelines below for how to write progress reports)

### 1.2. Communication Protocol
- Explain intended actions before execution
- Seek confirmation for significant changes
- Ask specific questions when clarification is needed
- Highlight assumptions explicitly
- Provide options rather than single solutions when appropriate
- Present pros and cons for important decisions

### 1.3. Quality Standards
- Write maintainable, well-commented code
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Prioritize readability over cleverness, but still be clever when readability is already achieved
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Include appropriate logging
- Consider performance implications

## 2. PRDs/Project Plans

Every project needs a PRD or plan document. See [prd_format.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prd_format.mdc).
