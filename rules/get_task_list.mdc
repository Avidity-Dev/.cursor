# Task-Magic – Task Inventory Helper

This repository contains a helper script at
[`_parallel/get_task_list.sh`](mdc:_parallel/get_task_list.sh) that scans all
Task-Magic projects (_parallel/projects/\*) and produces a CSV table of **every**
`taskNN_\*`Markdown file together with its`status`and`title` taken from the
YAML front-matter.

## When to use this rule

Use the script when you need a quick, authoritative list of completed vs.
active tasks, especially before synchronising with Linear or generating
backlog reports.

## Usage

```bash
bash _parallel/get_task_list.sh > tasks_inventory.csv
```

The generated CSV columns are:

1. `project` – project directory name
2. `file` – relative path to the task file
3. `status` – YAML `status:` value (`completed`, `pending`, `in_progress`, …)
4. `title` – YAML `title:` value

## Implementation details

- Script is portable across macOS (BSD tools) and Linux (GNU tools).
- It detects YAML front-matter by looking for the opening and closing `---`
  delimiters and stops parsing after the second delimiter.
- Defaults to `UNKNOWN` if either key is missing.
- Sorting is applied for deterministic output.

Keep this rule handy whenever you need to audit Task-Magic progress or reconcile
with external trackers like Linear.
