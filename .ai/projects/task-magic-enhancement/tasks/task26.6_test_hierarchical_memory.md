## Description

Create sample archived tasks, test archival flows, verify aggregation works, and validate backwards compatibility.

## Details

- **End-to-End Testing**:

  - Create sample completed tasks in the project
  - Test archiving them to project memory
  - Verify project MEMORY.md is updated correctly
  - Test global aggregation updates GLOBAL_MEMORY.md
  - Confirm INDEX.md memory references work

- **Backwards Compatibility Testing**:

  - Test that existing global memory files still work
  - Verify workspace-level task archival still functions
  - Confirm existing archived tasks remain accessible
  - Test that global TASKS_LOG.md continues to work

- **Integration Testing**:

  - Test memory navigation from INDEX.md
  - Verify project memory isolation (one project doesn't affect another)
  - Test aggregation with multiple projects
  - Confirm all memory commands work in new system

- **Performance and Usability Testing**:
  - Test with larger numbers of archived tasks
  - Verify memory aggregation performance
  - Test usability of navigation and organization
  - Confirm system scales well with multiple projects

## Test Strategy

- Execute comprehensive test suite covering all memory functionality
- Document test results and any issues found
- Verify all requirements from original task 26 are met
- Confirm system is ready for production use
- Create validation checklist for future memory system changes
