## Description

Create INDEX.md as the central project discovery mechanism

## Details

- Create `.ai/INDEX.md` file
- Design table format for project listing
- Include columns: Project, ID, Status, Lead Files, Tags
- Add project discovery instructions
- Reference agent guides
- Include quick links to system docs and logs

## Test Strategy

- Verify INDEX.md exists at .ai/ root
- Confirm table renders properly in markdown
- Check that project links work correctly
- Validate discovery instructions are clear

## Agent Notes

Created INDEX.md with task-magic-enhancement as the first registered project. Table format provides clear overview of all active projects.
