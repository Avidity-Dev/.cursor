## Description

Create GLOBAL_MEMORY.md and implement logic to aggregate insights from all project memory files.

## Details

- Create `.ai/memory/GLOBAL_MEMORY.md` file as the cross-project memory aggregator
- Implement logic to scan all project memory files (`.ai/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md`)
- Aggregate key insights, patterns, and learnings across projects
- Structure GLOBAL_MEMORY.md with sections for:
  - Cross-project patterns and learnings
  - Architecture decisions that affect multiple projects
  - Best practices discovered across projects
  - Common challenges and solutions
  - Project lifecycle insights
- Create mechanism to update GLOBAL_MEMORY.md when project memories change
- Design aggregation to be human-readable and AI-friendly
- Ensure aggregation logic can be triggered manually or automatically

## Test Strategy

- Create sample project memory files and test aggregation
- Verify GLOBAL_MEMORY.md captures cross-project insights
- Test that aggregation updates correctly when project memories change
- Confirm global memory provides useful high-level overview
- Validate that both manual and automatic aggregation work properly
