## Description

Update README and index to properly explain rule dispatcher role and legacy detection

## Details

- Update `.cursor/rules/task-magic/README.md` to explain index as rule dispatcher
- Enhance `.cursor/rules/task-magic/_index.mdc` with legacy detection triggers
- Fix outdated system descriptions throughout documentation
- Ensure cross-references between rules are working correctly

## Follow-up Context

**Parent Task:** Task 25 - Consolidate Legacy System Guidance
**Trigger:** Post-completion scope addition discovered during task review
**Relationship:** Ensures documentation clarity for the consolidated legacy guidance rule

## Test Strategy

- Verify README clearly explains index role as rule dispatcher
- Confirm index contains proper legacy detection triggers
- Check that all system descriptions are consistent with enhanced system
- Validate cross-references work correctly between rules

## Agent Notes

This follow-up task demonstrates the new scope management system where post-completion work gets proper task structure rather than modifying completed tasks.
