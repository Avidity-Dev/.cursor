## Description

Parent task for implementing a hierarchical memory system where each project manages its own complete lifecycle including memory, with a global memory aggregator that summarizes all project memories. This task has been expanded into sub-tasks and serves as a tracker.

## Details

**This task has been expanded into the following sub-tasks:**

- task26.1_create_project_memory_structure.md - Create Project Memory Directory Structure
- task26.2_update_archival_process.md - Update Task Archival Process for Project Memory
- task26.3_implement_global_aggregation.md - Implement Global Memory Aggregation System
- task26.4_enhance_index_with_memory.md - Enhance INDEX.md with Memory References
- task26.5_update_rules_documentation.md - Update Task Magic Rules Documentation
- task26.6_test_hierarchical_memory.md - Test Hierarchical Memory System

**Parent task completion depends on all sub-tasks being completed.**

**Original Implementation Goals:**

- **Project Memory Structure**: Each project will have its own `memory/` subdirectory containing archived tasks and project summaries
- **Global Memory Enhancement**: Enhance the global memory system to aggregate insights from all project memory files
- **Benefits**: Project-centric organization, scalable to multiple projects, portable project contexts, clear separation between project-specific and cross-project insights

## Test Strategy

This parent task is complete when all sub-tasks (26.1 through 26.6) are completed and the hierarchical memory system is fully functional and tested.
