## Description

Update the existing INDEX.md to include references to project memory files and summaries.

## Details

- Enhance the project table in `.ai/INDEX.md` to include memory references
- Add a "Memory" column or section that links to project memory files
- Include quick access links to:
  - Project MEMORY.md files
  - Global GLOBAL_MEMORY.md
  - Key project learnings and insights
- Update the Quick Links section to include memory navigation
- Ensure INDEX.md serves as the central navigation hub for both active projects and their histories
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing INDEX.md structure
- Make memory references intuitive and easy to navigate
- Consider adding memory status indicators (e.g., "3 archived tasks", "Last updated: date")

## Test Strategy

- Verify INDEX.md properly links to all project memory files
- Test that memory navigation is intuitive and functional
- Confirm backward compatibility with existing structure
- Validate that memory status indicators are accurate
- Test navigation from INDEX.md to various memory components
