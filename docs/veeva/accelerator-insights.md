PROMPT:

@PRD_018_vault_to_flake.md  is a prd that is pretty well fleshed out. the goal is to add direct data api as a source to our data engineering repo. we will move data from veeva vault crm to azure blob, where we will extract the data from the .tar.gz file(s) and then use dlt to load that data into snowflake. ive also attached relevant cursor rules that explain the dataeng repo and more about the direct data api.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO:

@snowflake is a repository from veeva where they give accelerator scripts for working with ddapi. they use a different approach (not dlt), but i wonder if there is anything we can learn about how to handle the data from it. would you look through the files in that repo? act like sherlock holmes, sleuthing through the code to find important details that help us see the larger picture more clearly.

RESPONSE:

[ARCHITECT MODE ENGAGED]

Excellent! We have a well-defined plan in `PRD_018_vault_to_flake.md` for ingesting Veeva Vault CRM data into Snowflake using `dlt`. The PRD leverages our `veeva-direct-data-api-usage` and `veeva-data-handling-notes` rules, which provide a solid foundation.

You're right to suggest looking at Veeva's own accelerator scripts, even if they use a different approach. Often, vendor-provided examples contain subtle but crucial details about data handling, API quirks, or recommended practices that can be invaluable. It's like finding an old map of a dungeon you're about to explore – even if you have newer tools, the old map might show hidden passages or traps!

I shall now channel my inner Sherlock Holmes and examine the `@snowflake` accelerator repository. My goal is to uncover any "clues" – be it in data processing logic, schema handling, or interaction with the Veeva API – that could refine our `dlt`-based solution.

I'll start by examining the `accelerator.py` file you've attached. This is often the main entry point or orchestrator script.

Ah, it appears there's a slight hiccup. The path `prometheus/Vault-Direct-Data-API-Accelerators/accelerators/snowflake/accelerator.py` seems to be incorrect as the file wasn't found in the workspace.

Could you please confirm the correct path to the `accelerator.py` file within your workspace? The initial attachment mentioned the folder `/Users/michaelhood/Vault-Direct-Data-API-Accelerators/accelerators/snowflake`, so I'll assume the file is directly within that path for now.

Let me try reading `accelerator.py` from the path I infer from your manual attachment message.



Read file: /Users/michaelhood/Vault-Direct-Data-API-Accelerators/accelerators/snowflake/accelerator.py
Okay, `accelerator.py` provides a clear, high-level view of the accelerator's workflow. This is our "Rosetta Stone" for understanding the repository's structure and intent.

Here's what I've deduced:

1.  **Orchestration**: The `main()` function orchestrates a three-step process:
    *   `direct_data_to_object_storage.run()`: Fetches data from Veeva and lands it in S3.
    *   `download_and_unzip_direct_data_files.run()`: Downloads from S3 (presumably to a local/staging area), unzips, and optionally converts to Parquet.
    *   `load_data.run()`: Loads the processed data into Snowflake.

2.  **Configuration**: It relies on two configuration files:
    *   `connector_config.json`: Contains parameters for Direct Data, S3, Snowflake, and a flag for Parquet conversion.
    *   `vapil_settings.json`: Likely contains Veeva API connection details (VAPIL is Veeva's API).

3.  **Services**: It uses dedicated service classes for interacting with external systems:
    *   `VaultService`: For Veeva API interactions.
    *   `AwsS3Service`: For S3 operations.
    *   `SnowflakeService`: For Snowflake operations.

4.  **Modularity**: The core logic for each step is encapsulated in separate modules within the `accelerators.snowflake.scripts` package:
    *   `direct_data_to_object_storage`
    *   `download_and_unzip_direct_data_files`
    *   `load_data`

**Relevance to Our PRD (`PRD_018_vault_to_flake.md`):**

*   **Staging Location**: The accelerator explicitly stages data in S3 *before* further processing. Our PRD assumes files are already landed in a cloud storage location (Azure Blob in our case), which aligns with this initial step. The `direct_data_to_object_storage.py` script might contain useful logic for interacting with the Veeva Direct Data API to list and download files if we ever need to build that part.
*   **Unzipping and Format Conversion**: The `download_and_unzip_direct_data_files.py` script is particularly interesting. While our `dlt` transformer in the PRD aims to process the `.tar.gz` stream directly, this script's approach to unzipping and potentially converting to Parquet could offer insights into:
    *   Efficiently handling the tarball contents.
    *   The structure of the files within the tarball (manifest, data CSVs).
    *   Any specific considerations for Parquet conversion if we ever explore that.
*   **Loading Logic**: The `load_data.py` script will be crucial. It should reveal how Veeva's accelerator handles:
    *   Schema creation/mapping in Snowflake.
    *   Staging and merging data (handling initial vs. incremental loads, deletes).
    *   Parsing `manifest.csv` and `metadata.csv`.

**Next Steps in Our Investigation:**

To delve deeper, I'll now list the contents of the `scripts/` and `services/` directories, as these seem to hold the core implementation details.

I'll start with `scripts/`.



Ran tool
Excellent, this confirms the three key script files we identified from `accelerator.py`:

*   `load_data.py`
*   `download_and_unzip_direct_data_files.py`
*   `direct_data_to_object_storage.py`

Now, let's look into the `services/` directory.



Ran tool
This also aligns with our expectations:

*   `vault_service.py`
*   `snowflake_service.py`
*   `aws_s3_service.py`

**Sherlock's Path Forward:**

Given our PRD's focus on processing already-landed `.tar.gz` files and loading them into Snowflake using `dlt`, the most pertinent files from the accelerator for our current investigation are likely:

1.  **`download_and_unzip_direct_data_files.py`**: This should show how they handle the `.tar.gz` archives, extract contents, and potentially parse the manifest. This is directly comparable to what our `read_tar_gz` `dlt` transformer aims to do.
2.  **`load_data.py`**: This will reveal their logic for interacting with Snowflake, including schema management, handling incremental data, deletes, and utilizing metadata. This is crucial for understanding how Veeva envisions the data being structured and maintained in a data warehouse.
3.  **`snowflake_service.py`**: This will contain the lower-level SQL commands and interactions with Snowflake, potentially showing specific patterns for creating tables, staging data, and performing MERGE operations.

While `direct_data_to_object_storage.py` and `vault_service.py` would be interesting if we were building the Veeva-to-cloud-storage part, our PRD currently has that as a pre-existing step. We can keep them in mind if we need to revisit that part later.

I'll start by examining `download_and_unzip_direct_data_files.py`. Its logic for handling the tarballs is key.



Read file: /Users/michaelhood/Vault-Direct-Data-API-Accelerators/accelerators/snowflake/scripts/download_and_unzip_direct_data_files.py
This script, `download_and_unzip_direct_data_files.py`, is quite revealing! Here are the key observations and their implications for our `dlt` pipeline:

**Core Logic:**

1.  **Downloads from S3**: It first fetches the entire `.tar.gz` from S3.
    *   `tarfile_content: bytes = get_object_response['Body'].read()`
    *   **Critique for our PRD**: This reads the *entire* tarball into memory (`tarfile_content`). This is precisely what our PRD's `read_tar_gz` transformer aims to *avoid* by streaming. For large Veeva files, this in-memory approach could lead to OOM errors, validating our PRD's emphasis on streaming.

2.  **Tarball Handling**:
    *   It uses `tarfile.open(fileobj=gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=BytesIO(tarfile_content), mode='rb'), mode='r') as tar:`.
    *   This construction first wraps the in-memory `tarfile_content` (which is a `bytes` object) in a `BytesIO` buffer to make it file-like, then passes it to `gzip.GzipFile` for decompression, and finally, the result of that is passed to `tarfile.open`.
    *   **Observation**: While it processes member by member (`for member in tar.getmembers():`), the initial decompression of the *entire gzipped content* and holding the tarball's structure in memory might still be a concern for very large archives, though less so than reading the entire uncompressed content of all files. Our PRD's approach of `tarfile.open(fileobj=stream, mode="r:gz")` directly on the incoming `FileItemDict` stream is more memory-efficient as `tarfile` handles the streaming decompression internally.

3.  **File Extraction and Local Staging**:
    *   `file_content = tar.extractfile(member).read()`: It reads the entire content of each member file into memory.
    *   `extract_file_path: str = os.path.join(output_directory, member.name)`: It reconstructs the file path locally.
    *   `with open(extract_file_path, 'wb') as file: file.write(file_content)`: It writes the extracted file to the local disk.
    *   **Critique for our PRD**: Our `dlt` transformer in the PRD intends to read each internal file stream (e.g., CSV) directly and yield its rows, without necessarily writing intermediate files to local disk. This accelerator's approach of writing to disk and then re-uploading to S3 (either as CSV or Parquet) introduces I/O overhead and requires local disk space. This reinforces the elegance of the `dlt` streaming approach.

4.  **Parquet Conversion (Optional)**:
    *   If `convert_to_parquet` is true and the file is a `.csv`, it uses `pandas.read_csv(BytesIO(file_content))` to read the CSV into a DataFrame, then `pyarrow.Table.from_pandas()` and `pq.write_table()` to convert and write to a local Parquet file.
    *   **Observation**: This is a standard way to convert CSV to Parquet. If we ever need Parquet, this logic is sound, though again, it involves reading the whole CSV into memory via pandas. For very large individual CSV files within the tarball, this could also be memory-intensive.

5.  **Re-uploads to S3**: After processing (and potential conversion), it uploads the individual files (CSV or Parquet) back to S3, maintaining a similar directory structure.
    *   `s3_service.put_object(key=s3_destination_key, body=...)`
    *   **Implication for PRD**: This step is entirely different from our `dlt` pipeline's goal, which is to load data *directly* into Snowflake from the processed stream, not to re-stage individual processed files in object storage.

**Key Learnings & "Clues" for Our `dlt` Pipeline:**

*   **Memory Efficiency is Paramount**: The accelerator's approach of reading the whole tarball into memory (`tarfile_content`) and then each member file into memory (`file_content`, `csv_df`) highlights the importance of the streaming strategy outlined in our PRD for the `read_tar_gz` transformer. Our PRD correctly identifies this as a critical design choice.
*   **Tarball Structure**: It iterates through `tar.getmembers()` and uses `member.name` to get file paths. This is standard and aligns with what our `read_tar_gz` would do. It doesn't explicitly show parsing of `manifest.csv` in *this* script; that logic might be in `load_data.py` or assumed to be handled by the user interpreting the S3 structure later. Our PRD's `read_tar_gz` is more sophisticated by trying to use `manifest.csv` first.
*   **Error Handling**: It has `try-except` blocks for `tarfile.TarError` and `gzip.BadGzipFile`, which is good practice. Our transformer should also include robust error handling for malformed archives.
*   **No Manifest Usage Here**: This script doesn't seem to use a `manifest.csv` to guide extraction. It processes every file within the tarball. Our PRD's approach of using the manifest is more targeted and likely more efficient, as it would only process data files listed there.

**Conclusion from `download_and_unzip_direct_data_files.py`:**

This script reinforces the validity of our PRD's design choice to **stream the tarball and its internal files directly** within the `dlt` transformer. The accelerator's method, while functional, involves multiple in-memory buffering steps and intermediate disk I/O that our `dlt` approach elegantly sidesteps. The primary value here is seeing a contrasting (and less memory-efficient for large files) way of handling the tarball, which underscores the benefits of our chosen path.

Next, I'll examine `load_data.py`. This is where we expect to find logic related to Snowflake interaction, schema handling, and how the actual data (CSV or Parquet) is processed and loaded. This should be very informative!



Read file: /Users/michaelhood/Vault-Direct-Data-API-Accelerators/accelerators/snowflake/scripts/load_data.py
This `load_data.py` script is packed with fascinating details directly relevant to our PRD! It outlines how Veeva's accelerator approaches loading data into Snowflake, especially concerning metadata, schema evolution, and incremental processing.

Let's break down the "clues":

**1. Manifest and Metadata are Key:**

*   **Manifest Processing**:
    *   It downloads and reads `manifest.csv` (or `.parquet`) from S3 into a pandas DataFrame. This is the central piece for driving the load process.
    *   It filters the manifest for rows with `type == "updates"` and `records > 0` to process actual data files.
*   **Metadata Processing**:
    *   For `full` or `log` extracts, it downloads and reads `Metadata/metadata.csv` (or `metadata_full.csv`) to define table structures.
    *   For `incremental` extracts, it has a dedicated `handle_metadata_changes` function that looks for `Metadata.metadata` entries in the manifest with `type` as `deletes` or `updates`. This is how it seems to pick up schema changes from incremental feeds.

**2. Schema Handling (Explicit DDL Management):**

*   **Table Creation (Full Load)**:
    *   If `infer_schema` is `False` (which seems to be the more robust path), it calls `snowflake_service.create_all_tables()` using the main metadata file. This implies the `SnowflakeService` has logic to translate Veeva metadata types into Snowflake DDL.
*   **Schema Evolution (Incremental Load - `handle_metadata_updates` & `handle_metadata_deletes`):**
    *   `handle_metadata_updates`:
        *   Reads the specific metadata update file (e.g., `Metadata/metadata_updates.csv`).
        *   For each `extract` (table) in this metadata file:
            *   If the table is new (checked by presence of an `id` column in its metadata, a heuristic perhaps for "is this a main object table?"), it calls `snowflake_service.create_single_table()`.
            *   Otherwise, it retrieves existing column info from Snowflake, compares it with the incoming metadata, and builds `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...` or `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY COLUMN ...` statements. The `create_sql_str` method in `SnowflakeService` likely formats these.
    *   `handle_metadata_deletes`:
        *   Reads the specific metadata delete file.
        *   For each `extract`:
            *   If `id` is among the columns to be deleted (again, a heuristic), it drops the *entire table* (`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`). This is a significant behavior for object deletions.
            *   Otherwise, it generates `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN ...`.
*   **Table Naming**: `update_table_name_that_starts_with_digit()` suggests some Veeva extract names might not be valid SQL table names directly.

**3. Data Loading (COPY INTO from Stage):**

*   **Snowflake Stage**: It checks if a Snowflake stage exists (`snowflake_service.check_if_stage_exists()`), implying it uses Snowflake's internal or external stages for loading. This is standard practice.
*   **File Formats**: It creates Snowflake file formats (`parquet_file_format` or `csv_file_format`) dynamically.
*   **Processing Manifest Rows**: The `snowflake_service.process_manifest_row()` function is called for each data file entry in the manifest. This function likely:
    *   Constructs a `COPY INTO <table> FROM @stage/path/to/file` command.
    *   Uses the appropriate file format.
    *   Handles `MATCH_BY_COLUMN_NAME` for Parquet.
    *   Possibly manages schema inference if `infer_schema` is true (though the script leans towards explicit DDL).

**4. Incremental Data Handling:**

*   **Deletes**: For incremental loads, *before* processing updates, it calls `snowflake_service.delete_data_from_table()`. This function would need to look at files marked as `_deletes.csv` (or similar, based on manifest info) and issue `DELETE` statements or `MERGE` statements against the target tables in Snowflake. The exact mechanism isn't fully detailed here but is a critical function of `SnowflakeService`.
*   **Updates/Inserts**: The `COPY INTO` commands for files from the manifest (filtered for `type == "updates"`) will handle inserts of new records and overwriting/merging of existing records, depending on how staging tables and `MERGE` statements are structured within `SnowflakeService`.

**Implications and Learnings for Our `dlt` Pipeline (PRD_018):**

*   **Metadata-Driven Schema**: The accelerator heavily relies on Veeva's `metadata.csv`. Our `dlt` pipeline should also prioritize parsing this file to:
    *   Define table schemas, including data types and lengths. `dlt` can accept explicit schema hints.
    *   Detect schema changes in incremental loads and potentially alert or attempt to apply them (though `dlt` also has its own schema evolution capabilities).
*   **Explicit DDL vs. `dlt` Schema Evolution**:
    *   The accelerator takes a very explicit DDL management approach (`CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`).
    *   `dlt` offers more automated schema evolution (adding columns, altering types where safe). We need to decide how much control we want. We could:
        1.  Let `dlt` handle schema evolution based on the data it sees (potentially guided by an initial schema from `metadata.csv`).
        2.  Develop a pre-processing step (perhaps a separate `dlt` resource or Python function before the main load) that parses `metadata.csv` from incremental files and uses `dlt.schema.utils.diff_schemas` or similar logic to detect changes, then potentially uses `dlt.pipeline.client.run_sql` to apply `ALTER TABLE` commands *before* `dlt` loads the data. This would mimic the accelerator's explicit control.
        3.  A hybrid: provide an initial schema to `dlt` from the Full Load's `metadata.csv` and let `dlt` evolve it, but also monitor `metadata.csv` changes for significant alterations (like column drops or type changes `dlt` can't handle automatically) and alert.
*   **Handling Deletes**:
    *   The PRD mentions `dlt`'s `write_disposition="merge"` with primary keys. This is crucial.
    *   The accelerator's `delete_data_from_table()` suggests Veeva provides explicit delete information. Our `read_tar_gz` transformer needs to identify these delete records/files (likely from `manifest.csv` pointing to `_deletes.csv` files) and yield them in a way that `dlt` can use for merging/deleting (e.g., by adding a special column like `_dlt_is_deleted=True` or by routing them to a resource that uses a specific merge key and deletes on match).
*   **Table and Column Naming Conventions**: The `update_table_name_that_starts_with_digit` function is a small but important detail. We should anticipate and handle such naming adjustments in our `dlt` pipeline, potentially during the table name derivation in `read_tar_gz` or via `dlt`'s naming convention options.
*   **Full vs. Incremental Logic Separation**: The script clearly distinguishes logic for full loads (table creation) versus incremental loads (schema changes, deletes, then updates). Our `dlt` pipeline will inherently handle the "first run is like a full load" aspect, but the schema evolution and delete handling will need careful design for incrementals.
*   **`id` Column Heuristic**: The use of the `id` column's presence/absence in metadata to decide between `CREATE TABLE` vs. `ALTER TABLE` or `DROP TABLE` vs. `DROP COLUMN` is an interesting, if potentially brittle, heuristic. It suggests that "main" Veeva objects might always have an `id` column, while other associated data (like relationship tables or complex field expansions) might not. This could inform how we define primary keys in `dlt`.

**This `load_data.py` is a goldmine!** It strongly suggests that a robust Veeva integration requires careful handling of the `manifest.csv` and `metadata.csv` to manage DDL and process data types correctly.

Before synthesizing a final plan, I'd like to peek into `snowflake_service.py` to see some of the actual SQL generation, particularly `create_all_tables`, `create_single_table`, `process_manifest_row`, and `delete_data_from_table`. This will give us concrete examples of their SQL patterns.



Read file: /Users/michaelhood/Vault-Direct-Data-API-Accelerators/accelerators/snowflake/services/snowflake_service.py
The `SnowflakeService.py` script is the engine room for database interactions, and it's incredibly insightful. It confirms many of our deductions from `load_data.py` and provides concrete SQL patterns.

**Key Findings from `SnowflakeService.py`:**

1.  **Type Mapping (`create_sql_str`)**:
    *   This static method is responsible for converting Veeva data types (from `metadata.csv`) into Snowflake column types.
    *   It has explicit mappings:
        *   `id` or `string` (if column name is `id`) -> `VARCHAR()` (length not specified here, implies default or handled elsewhere)
        *   `datetime`, `timestamp with time zone` -> `TIMESTAMP_TZ`
        *   `boolean` -> `BOOLEAN`
        *   `number`, `numeric` -> `NUMERIC`
        *   `date` -> `DATE`
        *   Default: `VARCHAR()`
    *   This is crucial for our `dlt` pipeline. We'll need a similar mapping when defining or hinting `dlt` schemas based on Veeva's `metadata.csv`.
    *   It also handles generating `ADD COLUMN` and `MODIFY COLUMN` syntax.

2.  **Table Creation (`create_single_table`, `create_all_tables`)**:
    *   `create_single_table`: Executes a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement using the column definitions from `create_sql_str`.
    *   `create_all_tables`: Iterates through unique extracts in the metadata, calls `create_single_table` for each.
        *   **Special Handling**: It has hardcoded adjustments for specific columns in `Document.document_version__sys` and `Object.security_policy__sys`, overriding their type/length. This is a "clue" that Veeva's own metadata might sometimes need minor corrections or specific interpretations for optimal DWH loading. We should be aware of such potential edge cases.
        *   It also creates a dedicated `metadata` table in Snowflake to store the content of `metadata.csv` itself.

3.  **Schema Querying (`retrieve_column_info`)**:
    *   Uses `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` to get existing table structures. This is standard and used for schema comparison during `ALTER TABLE` operations in `load_data.py`.

4.  **Staging and Loading (`check_if_stage_exists`, `load_data_into_tables`)**:
    *   `check_if_stage_exists`: Creates a Snowflake stage (e.g., `CREATE STAGE my_stage URL = 's3://bucket/path/' ...`) if it doesn't exist. This stage points to the S3 location where processed files (CSVs/Parquets) are stored by `download_and_unzip_direct_data_files.py`.
    *   `load_data_into_tables`:
        *   **Full/Log Loads**: Uses `COPY INTO <table> FROM @stage/... FILE_FORMAT = ...`. If `infer_schema` is true, it first creates the table using `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ... USING TEMPLATE (SELECT ARRAY_AGG(OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(*)) FROM TABLE(INFER_SCHEMA(...)))`.
        *   **Incremental Loads (MERGE)**: This is the most complex and interesting part.
            1.  Creates a temporary table (`CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE <temp_table_name> AS SELECT * FROM <target_table> LIMIT 0;`) with the same structure as the target table.
            2.  `COPY INTO <temp_table_name>` from the staged incremental file.
            3.  Constructs a `MERGE INTO <target_table> USING <temp_table_name>` statement.
            4.  **Join Condition (`ON ...`)**:
                *   For `picklist__sys`: `target."object" = source."object" AND target."object_field" = source."object_field" AND target."picklist_value_name" = source."picklist_value_name"` (composite key).
                *   For `metadata` table: `target."extract" = source."extract" AND target."column_name" = source."column_name"` (composite key).
                *   **Default**: `target."id" = source."id"`. This confirms the `id` column is the standard primary key for most entities.
            5.  `WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ...` (updates all columns).
            6.  `WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (...) VALUES (...)`.

5.  **Handling Deletes (`delete_data_from_table`, `process_delete`)**:
    *   `delete_data_from_table` iterates through manifest entries where `type == "deletes"`.
    *   `process_delete`:
        1.  Identifies the target table name (e.g., from `myobject_deletes.csv` to `myobject`).
        2.  Creates another temporary table (e.g., `temp_myobject_deletes`) with just the key columns (`id`, or composite keys for picklist/metadata).
        3.  `COPY INTO` the delete keys from the `_deletes.csv` file into this temporary delete key table.
        4.  Executes `DELETE FROM <target_table> WHERE <key_columns> IN (SELECT <key_columns> FROM <temp_delete_key_table>);`.

**Sherlock's Synthesis & Implications for Our `dlt` Pipeline:**

This deep dive has been incredibly fruitful! Here's how these findings from Veeva's accelerator can inform and refine our `PRD_018_vault_to_flake.md`:

1.  **`read_tar_gz` Transformer (PRD Task 2.3)**:
    *   **Metadata Parsing**: It *must* robustly parse `manifest.csv` to identify data files, their types (update, delete), and corresponding Veeva extract names. It should also be prepared to parse `metadata.csv` (from Full or Incremental) to extract column names, Veeva types, and lengths.
    *   **Type Conversion Logic**: Incorporate a type mapping similar to `SnowflakeService.create_sql_str` when preparing data or schema hints for `dlt`. This ensures data types are correctly interpreted.
    *   **Naming Conventions**: Implement logic to sanitize table and column names (e.g., `update_table_name_that_starts_with_digit`, ensure lowercase or consistent casing for `dlt`).
    *   **Yielding Deletes**: When a `_deletes` file is processed, the transformer should yield items suitable for `dlt`'s merge strategy. This likely means yielding dictionaries containing only the primary key(s) and marking them for deletion, perhaps by adding a field like `_dlt_is_deleted: True` if `dlt` supports such a convention directly for its `merge` disposition, or by ensuring they are routed to a resource with appropriate merge keys configured to delete on match. The accelerator's `DELETE FROM ... WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM temp_deletes_table)` pattern is a classic way to handle this; `dlt`'s `merge` aims to simplify this.

2.  **`dlt` Pipeline Configuration (PRD Task 3.1 & 3.4)**:
    *   **Primary Keys**: The accelerator's `MERGE` logic confirms `id` as the common primary key. For specific tables like `picklist__sys` and the internally created `metadata` table, composite keys are used. We must configure these accurately in our `dlt.resource` definitions using `primary_key=("key1", "key2")`.
    *   **Write Disposition**: `write_disposition="merge"` is the correct choice for most tables. We need to ensure `merge_key` is also correctly specified, which will typically be the same as `primary_key`.
    *   **Schema Definition**:
        *   For the initial load (Full file), we can generate a `dlt.Schema` object by parsing `metadata.csv` and applying our type mappings and naming conventions. This schema can then be supplied to the `dlt.pipeline.run(..., schema=my_veeva_schema)` call.
        *   For incremental loads, `dlt` will attempt to evolve this schema. We should investigate if `dlt`'s native schema evolution (e.g., `evolve="evolve"`, `evolve="discard-value"`) is sufficient or if we need to implement a pre-step to explicitly apply `ALTER TABLE` commands based on diffing Veeva's incremental `metadata.csv` against our current `dlt` schema (similar to `handle_metadata_updates` and `handle_metadata_deletes` but using `dlt.pipeline.client.run_sql` or `dlt.pipeline.client.schema.replace_schema`). The latter gives more control but adds complexity. Given `dlt`'s capabilities, starting with its native evolution and monitoring is a good first step.
    *   **Hardcoded Adjustments**: Be mindful of the special type/length adjustments seen in `SnowflakeService.create_all_tables`. We might need to incorporate these into our schema generation logic if Veeva's metadata is indeed sometimes imprecise for DWH purposes for specific system tables.

3.  **Testing (PRD Task 4.4)**:
    *   Test cases should cover scenarios with composite primary keys.
    *   Test schema evolution, especially addition of new columns and ensuring type changes are handled as expected by `dlt`.
    *   Thoroughly test the delete mechanism.

**Refined Approach for PRD (incorporating learnings):**

*   **`read_tar_gz` Transformer**:
    1.  Stream tarball.
    2.  Prioritize `manifest.csv` to find data files, types (`updates`, `deletes`), record counts, and Veeva `extract` names.
    3.  If `manifest.csv` indicates metadata files (`Metadata.metadata` with type `updates` or `deletes` for incremental, or the main `metadata.csv` for full), parse these *first* to understand schema.
        *   This metadata should be used to derive `dlt` table names (sanitized), column names (sanitized), and `dlt` column types (using our mapping).
        *   Store this schema information (perhaps as a dictionary per table) to be used when yielding data.
    4.  For each data file from the manifest:
        *   Stream the internal CSV.
        *   If it's a "deletes" file: Yield dictionaries containing only the primary key(s) of the records to be deleted. Mark these distinctly if `dlt` needs a special flag for deletes with `merge`, or ensure `dlt.resource` is configured to delete when only PKs are present in an update.
        *   If it's an "updates" file: Yield full data rows. Ensure data types are coerced/validated against the schema derived from Veeva's metadata.
        *   Use `dlt.mark.with_table_name` and potentially `dlt.mark.with_hints` if we need to specify `primary_key` or `merge_key` dynamically per yielded batch (though defining on the `@dlt.resource` is more common).
*   **`dlt` Resources**:
    *   Define resources dynamically based on the `extracts` found in `manifest.csv` or provide a comprehensive list if known.
    *   Set `primary_key` and `merge_key` based on Veeva's conventions (`id` or composite keys for picklists, etc.).
    *   Set `write_disposition="merge"`.
    *   Provide an initial `dlt.Schema` to the pipeline run, generated from the Full load's `metadata.csv`.
*   **Schema Evolution**: Start with `dlt`'s built-in schema evolution. Add monitoring for Veeva `metadata.csv` changes in incremental loads. If `dlt` struggles with certain complex changes (e.g., type changes it can't safely make, column drops), then consider adding an explicit schema diff/ALTER step.

This investigation has been highly valuable. We've confirmed the importance of several design choices in our PRD (like streaming and manifest parsing) and uncovered many specific details about Veeva data structure, type mapping, primary keys, and incremental load patterns that will be essential for a successful implementation.

This detailed understanding will allow us to build a more robust and accurate `dlt` pipeline. What are your thoughts on these findings and the refined approach?
