We now need to capture everything recently done.

Make sure to follow these guideliens:
- [ai_human_collaboration_protocol.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ai_human_collaboration_protocol.mdc)
- [git_best_practices.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/git_best_practices.mdc)

Please do the following:
1. Look at recent changes with `git status` and/or `git diff | cat`
2. Collect any additional learnings from recent chats
3. Create/Update a progress report: Write a detailed description of recent changes in a NEW markdown file under `docs/reports`
    - Include "RPT_XXX_" as a prefix for the file name. 
        - The XXX will be the next number relative to the other reports that are there. 
    - Include everything we've done since the previous commit. 
    - Don't be shy! You were a huge part of this. Let's track all of our achievements!
4. git add and commit the changes with a clear commit message
