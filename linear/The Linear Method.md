# The Linear Method

## Principles & Practices

Source: https://linear.app/method/introduction

### 1.1 Principles⁠

#### Build for the creators⁠

Software project management tools should build with the end users – the creators – in mind. Keeping individuals productive is more important than generating perfect reports.

#### Opinionated software⁠

Productivity software needs to be opinionated. It's the only way the product can truly do the heavy lifting. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.

#### Create momentum – don't sprint⁠

Find a cadence and routine of working. In cycles, you can decide priorities and assign responsibilities. The goal is to maintain a healthy momentum with your teams, not to rush towards the end.

#### Meaningful direction⁠

Even if your daily schedule is filled with smaller tasks, it's important to understand and remind everyone of the purpose and long-term goals of your work. Milestones, projects, and initiatives are all essential to consider when you plan your weekly schedules.

#### Aim for clarity⁠

Don't invent terms if possible, as these can confuse and have different meanings in different teams. Projects should be called projects.

#### Say no to busy work⁠

Your tools should not make you the designer and maintainer of them. A tool should work for you, not the other way around. Remove or automate "work around work", so you can focus on what really matters.

#### Simple first, then powerful⁠

Teams have different needs depending on their size. A tool should be simple to get started with and grow more powerful as you scale.

#### Decide and move on⁠

There isn't always a best answer. Sometimes the most important thing is to make a decision, and move on.

### 1.2 Practices⁠

#### Set strategic product initiatives⁠

Ambitious goals are the only way to make a significant impact. Companies should focus on them when they define their high-level direction. Reserve some space on your product timelines for unplanned work that comes up unexpectedly and allow your product plans to change if needed.

#### Connect daily work to larger goals with projects⁠

All projects and work should directly correlate to these goals. Review projects and their target dates during initiative meetings and pull from projects as you plan cycles.

#### Work in _n-week_ cycles⁠

Cycles create a healthy routine and focus teams on what needs to happen next. 2-week cycles are the most common in software building. They're short enough to not lose sight of other priorities, but long enough to build significant features. Cycles should feel reasonable. Don't overload cycles with tasks and let unfinished items move to the next cycle automatically.

#### Keep a manageable backlog⁠

You don't need to save every feature request or piece of feedback indefinitely. Important ones will resurface, low priority ones will never get fixed. A more focused backlog makes it easier and faster to plan cycles, and ensures that work will actually get done.

#### Mix feature and quality work⁠

All software has bugs, more than we can ever fix. Include bugs and other fixes as part of your cycles. Invest in tooling as it is a force multiplier if done right.

#### Specify project and issue owners⁠

Every project should have a named owner who's responsible for writing the project brief and delivery. The same rule applies to issues. Even if other people are involved, the responsibility should lie with a single person.

#### Write project specs⁠

Aim for brevity. Short specs are more likely to be read. The purpose of a spec is to briefly communicate the "why", "what" and "how" of the project to the rest of the team. Ideally these short documents force teams to scope out work so priorities are clear and teams avoid building the wrong thing.

#### Understand your users⁠

The more popular your product, the more feedback you'll get. Overflowing inboxes are a good sign (unless they're bug reports). Collect user feedback and use it as a research library when developing new features. Try to spot trends. Attach requests and feedback to the relevant issue, to bring the voice of your customers directly into product development. Reading feedback, even complaints, is an opportunity to get to know your users and build exactly what they actually need.

#### Scope issues to be as small as possible⁠

It's hard to see visible progress when working on large tasks, which can be demotivating. Break down work into smaller parts and create an issue for each one when possible. Ideally you can complete several concrete tasks each week. It feels great to mark issues as done.

#### Measure progress with actual work⁠

The clearest way to see whether something is complete or not is to show the diff in the code or design file. When the tasks are scoped small, your changes will be small and easier to review, too. Avoid massive pull requests or large design changes.

#### Run cross-functional teams⁠

Designers and engineers should work together on projects, creating a natural push and pull. Designers bring their skills to explore ideas and push your team's thinking. Engineers challenge thinking around implementation and bring the winning ideas to reality. The best creators often have a talent for both. 

#### Write a changelog⁠

Writing a changelog benefits both internal and external communication. Internally, it helps your team to track progress and reflect on what they have achieved. Externally, it keeps users informed about what's new and demonstrates your commitment to improving the product.

## 2 Direction

## 2.1 Set the product direction

Source: https://linear.app/method/product-direction

Setting direction is one of the most important things you'll do when building a product and company. A clear direction aligns everyone to work toward the same goals. It helps individuals make daily decisions, teams prioritize projects, and all members of your organization feel motivated toward a shared purpose. Without direction, it's harder to work together, know what to focus on, and make meaningful progress.

Initiatives are a critical tool for shaping this direction. The process of creating initiatives and mapping out a product journey forces you to articulate a vision and decide how to build toward it. The culminating product timeline sets a path of execution for the near future, slightly in front of you, and ideally a bit out of reach. Anyone in your company can look at the product initiatives to quickly understand what the most important streams of work are, why they matter, and how they are progressing.

Whether you're part of a three-person startup or one thousand employee company, a clearly defined set of product initiatives helps you and everyone you work with to make better decisions more quickly and focus on more valuable work. Clear product plans keep teams aligned even when individuals work independently. Ambitious product timelines push people to challenge themselves to do their best work. Visible initiatives motivate individuals by giving them context on why their work matters and create a culture of transparency that builds trust, making collaboration easier and even spurring it serendipitously.

### 2.2 Set useful goals

Source: https://linear.app/method/set-useful-goals

Startups move so fast that it's normal not to know what you're working on the next day let alone the next week. Goals are important to remind you what matters for the medium or long term success of the company. You might not feel like you have enough users or historical data to make decisions on what your goals should be. That's normal and in those situations, create a goal that propels you forward in some measurable way.

In the early days, it can be hard to hit those goals when you start from zero. The way to think about it is to walk back from that goal, what is the path there. Path to 10 users starts with 1 user, which starts with having a product that someone can find and start using. Your first meaningful goal getting there could be to find 10 users to use your product, then 100, then $1000 in MRR. Successful startups often start with something small, figure it out, and then scale. And remember, there is no limit to how fast you can grow.

### 2.3 Prioritize enablers and blockers

Source: https://linear.app/method/prioritize-enablers-and-blockers

It's really important to learn to prioritize work well and to be able to explain clearly why you did or did not prioritize something. You don't have unlimited resources or time, especially in the earlier stages of building a company, so you must use it well.

First, it's helpful to think of new features as additive _enablers_ or removing _blockers._ Enablers enable new functionality that usually makes the product more valuable or interesting. Blockers are gaps or friction that prevents a user/customer to use your product. Before building a feature, you should try to understand if the problem is truly preventing someone from using the product or a nice to have in their user experience. Growth at a company comes from investing your energy and effort on the right enablers and removing critical blockers.

Secondly, it's important to consider how timely something is to build. There will always be more to build than you have the resources to do so. In the early stages, there are a lot of features that you will need to build eventually. Prioritize things that help you move the needle this week or month. You want to ask yourself if this is important to be done now or can it be done later. If you are successful at completing the project or task, does it help you achieve your higher-level goals? Also figure out if there are compounding effects to building it now and how it adds complexity or costs (e.g. more customization support). 

For example, we launched Linear in beta with Google Logins support only since that was the fastest way to build authentication. We then moved on to other features instead of expanding authentication options. We knew that eventually, we would have to support pure email and other login methods to bring in more users and larger customers, but it wasn't necessary to get our beta user community up and running. This lets us move faster on other features.

### 2.4 Scope projects down

Source: https://linear.app/method/scope-projects

At the early stages, it's especially important to scope projects. Design projects so that they can be completed in 1–3 weeks with a team of 1–3 people. Smaller fixes or additions should take only hours or a day. 

Shorter projects force you to prioritize the most important feature set. They also get you into the habit of shipping continuously, which creates quick feedback loops with customers. Smaller teams help you move faster and reduce the management and communication overhead. When you're early in the product building stage, you don't know enough to predict whether a project will be impactful or not so it's better to avoid massive projects. If there is no way to scope down the project, then break it down into stages.

For example, we shipped the first versions of Cycles and Projects in the first couple of months of starting Linear. The MVP version of both of these features took us about two weeks to design and build. We shipped the early versions to ourselves and private beta users in the first week and started collecting user feedback immediately and fixing them in the following weeks. We've made a lot of improvements to Cycles and Projects since and both of them are now the major features of the product.

## 3 Building

### 3.1 Generate momentum

Source: https://linear.app/method/building-with-momentum

You and your whole team should always try to take swift action and make progress each day. Instead of thinking or talking about doing something, you decide to do it or not to do it. Then you do it today instead of tomorrow and this week instead of next week.

There will also be weeks when you won't necessarily know what is the most important thing to do or you are not sure what decision to make in the product. Don't become paralyzed in those moments–find a way to act instead. Trust your intuition and do something that seems to make sense. Talk to more users. You'll gain more clarity as more feedback rolls in. If you've designed your operations to move fast and learn, then you can correct or revert decisions.

Startups rarely die because they made too much progress or because of a single bad decision, but they do die when they move too slow or give up.

### 3.2 Write issues not user stories

Source: https://linear.app/method/write-issues-not-user-stories

At Linear, we don’t write user stories and think they’re an anti-pattern in product development. We write short and simple issues that describe the task in plain language instead.

The point of writing an issue is to communicate a task. It needs to be clear enough so that the assignee can perform it and also give enough context so that teammates who need to know understand what work is being done. So the goal when writing issues should be to do this as effectively and quickly as possible.


Why user stories are obsolete
User stories evolved over twenty years ago as a way to communicate what a customer wanted into product requirements that a software team could deliver. Fast forward to today and a lot of things have changed about how we build software. Customers are tech-savvy enough to articulate basic product requirements. We’ve developed standards for common features such as shopping carts, todo lists, and notifications so there is no need to explain how they should work. The best product and engineering teams understand their users deeply and are familiar with how their product should work.

User stories have become a cargo cult ritual that feels good but wastes a lot of resources and time. They’re a roundabout way to describe tasks, obscuring the work to be done. User stories are time-consuming to write and read and can silo engineers into a mechanical role where they code to the issue requirements instead of thinking about the user experience holistically at the product level. One reason user stories are complicated and difficult to scope is because they bring what should be product-level details into the task level. And frankly, they don’t match how we communicate about software in real conversations.

A better way to write issues
Write clear, simple issues that describe tasks in plain language. Write your own issues. Discuss the user experience at the product and feature level, not the task level. Instead of spending time creating user stories, spend it talking to users and thinking through features before building them.

Describe concrete tasks or problems
An issue should describe a task with a clear, defined outcome. This could be a piece of code, design, document, or action to be taken. If it’s not a task, then it doesn’t belong in the issue tracker. Maybe it’s a project idea that needs to be fleshed out in a document or conversation or a larger feature that should be broken down into smaller, tangible pieces of work.

There will be exceptions to this rule. For example, before working on a feature you’ll spend time exploring the design and technical approach. You can create placeholder issues in these instances to break down later (e.g. Explore design) or frame it as a deliverable (e.g. Write project spec).

Write clearly and directly
Write short and simple issue titles that directly state what the task is. The title should be easy to scan, since most people will read it on a list or board in the context of other issues. Descriptions should be optional–not required–and can include relevant thoughts or context as well as links to deeper discussions. Write only as much as you need to share to perform the task and communicate relevant information to the team.

When sharing a feature request or bug report, quote user feedback directly instead of summarizing it. Often, a customer describes the pain point more authentically than you could summarize it and it’s faster to copy and paste, too. Link to the customer conversation so that if more information is needed, it’s easy to get.

Write your own issues
Everyone on the team should write their own issues. It’s faster and easier for the person who understands how to do the work to write issues describing it. It also sets up your team to do a better job. When you write your own issues, it forces you to think through the problem at a deep level. This creates space to come up with even better approaches and makes it easier to spot shortcuts or missing parts in the plan. The practice also reframes how you approach work entirely. Instead of building to mark a task done or check off a list of requirements, your focus is on the product or project deliverable.

In some cases, it makes more sense to write issues for others such as when filing a bug report. This should be encouraged with the caveat that issues are written slightly differently. When writing the issue, frame it as an ask or describe the problem. Let the assignee come up with the solution and then rewrite the issue as a task.

Keep user experience discussions at the product level
Discuss the customer experience at the product level when you spec out projects and build your roadmap. Engage the full team in these conversations–designers, engineers, and customer-facing folks–so that everyone has a deep understanding of the user needs, limitations, and product requirements. Then delegate the work to project teams and expect them to deliver. They’ll understand the user experience intuitively, so you don’t need to clarify it at the task level.

How we work at Linear
We discuss a feature or project deeply before deciding on an implementation plan. The project owner writes specs and gathers feedback until we feel like we have the right approach. Only then do we start writing code. It’s not uncommon to take a couple weeks to think through a feature before building it but once we’ve come up with the right plan, it’s straight into execution mode. The project owner delegates the work, starting with individuals writing up their own issues.

### 3.3 Manage design projects

Source: https://linear.app/method/manage-design-projects

At Linear, we manage design tasks in the app and designers and engineers collaborate tightly when building features. The design process can seem incompatible with typical project management practices. It’s hard to predict what a design will look like at the outset of a project let alone to give estimates on when it will be ready. These are some ways that we approach design work for projects that help us strike a balance and work together effectively.

Verifying the problem
The first design task for any project is to understand and verify the problem. Sometimes the problem is clear and simple, such as to build out a screen. Sometimes the problem is unclear or poorly defined and needs some research before implementation. This is especially common when picking up feature requests from customers or teams that work outside of the product. Users will ask you to build a specific feature X to fix their problem Y. The sales team may push you to build feature X to meet a client request. However, their X is usually defined by their perception of the problem and limited by their understanding of how the product can be changed to resolve it. Design’s challenge is to investigate the surface-level issues to find the root cause and then solve for that. As a designer, the most important step is to verify the problem actually exists and is the right problem to solve.

At Linear, we do a lot of this design and research by playing with the product ourselves. The design team regularly reviews feature requests that come in from users through the Help + Feedback modal or in the public Slack community. We’ll discuss these as a team casually in Slack or on the Linear issue if it’s a feature we plan to implement. We also invest in writing out detailed project specs for each feature before building anything which forces us to think through the problem in depth.

The exploration stage
Once the problem is clarified, it’s time to explore different design options. We create an issue in Linear called “Explore designs” and keep that as a placeholder issue in the project.

At this stage, it’s important to explore the solution freely and without judging whether something is feasible, fits into your design system or is a good idea at all. Bad ideas are a natural step in the creative process, can help clarify your thinking, and even show you why something else is a better idea. Depending on a problem, exploration could take a few hours or a few days. It’ll include part research to learn best practices and find inspiration and part experimenting with options in Figma. A small feature might require a few takes with different UIs. A larger feature could end up going in multiple directions before you find the one that you like, usually after you’ve gotten feedback from others.

Watch Karri's Figma design demo: Linear 2020.12 release page

Using feedback to guide you
After some initial exploration, you should get feedback and reactions from other people starting with your teammates. Observe how they react. When they say something about the design, don’t just pay attention to what they say but ask them why they said it. You should get feedback while you are still exploring, so don’t worry about the details and polish. If people give you negative feedback, don’t take that as a sign the direction is necessarily bad but focus on learning why. It could be that you’re going in the right direction but the current version isn’t quite right or doesn’t fit into their understanding of the problem. Find the gaps in your design or the story and then fill them.

When getting feedback on the design, alternate between reviewing the overall design and gathering input on specific details. It’s often hard for people to give good feedback on both at once and easy to go off in unhelpful tangents if feedback requests aren’t focused. Set the expectation and let people know what type of feedback would be valuable for you to receive.

Choosing a direction
Eventually you’ll need to pick a direction for the design. Fleshing out the direction more could take a few hours or days and at the least you’ll want to have done a round of internal feedback in the design including the engineers who will be building the feature.

By this stage you should have a better understanding of what assets you’ll need to create and be able to come up with a list of concrete design tasks. The solution scaffold is there even if the details may change. You should make a list of the design pieces to focus on and get them done one by one. Marking something done feels good and can help you to focus on the next task at hand–even while you work on the overall design–so you avoid spinning your wheels too much.

The final solution and individual pieces should be informed by the engineers. They’ll be able to point out technical limitations and talk through alternatives with you. This is also good practice generally that gives engineering context and a deeper understanding of the problem they’re solving and makes collaborating easier.

Design and engineering handover
We get a lot of questions about how we manage handover at Linear between the design and engineering teams. We work collaboratively throughout the project design and implementation process and start working together when writing the project spec. We work in project teams and there’s always a designer on the team for any user-facing features. We have a separate design team in our Linear workspace but our projects are shared between the design team and the engineering team. The designers file their own issues. The engineers file their own issues. For anything requiring collaboration, we’ll use sub-issues to split up the design and engineering tasks.

How we work at Linear: Karri's design process
I personally have struggled with this kind of task system before as a designer. Designing something often feels holistic and hard to break down into concrete tasks. Once you change one part of the design you may want to change something else. There are also a lot of unknowns in the beginning so it can feel hard to plan ahead.

Overall as a company, we use projects to organize work when building out features. After we write the project spec, the first design task is usually “explore design” where I just use some time (a day to a week) to explore different directions and options and figure out the parts of the design. Then share them with the team for feedback. I often paste the Figma screens or just screenshots in Linear comments and @mention people I want feedback from. Adrien likes to share Loom videos in addition to posting the Figma link and gives a quick overview of changes and what he wants feedback on.

Once I have a better sense of the design and direction, I create a more specific task like “Design X view.” Having a discrete task that I can work on and eventually close feels more motivating than having a huge task that takes weeks. Once the design is complete, I often create an implementation sub-issue which I assign to the team lead or engineer. They can then reference the design decisions and Figma link in the design task as they implement the feature.

### 3.4 Build with users

Source: https://linear.app/method/build-with-users

Much of the early startup process is about learning what your customers want. You should seek out users or potential users for feedback, iterate, and be flexible to meet the demands of your customers and the market.

Vision vs Feedback
However, your task as a founder is to find a balance between building toward your vision/intuition and building what the users want. Too vision-based products might miss user and market needs while too reactive products become Frankenstein creations without a clear purpose. You need to keep refining your product vision based on your user feedback.

Solve the problem not the feature
Understand that users will project their needs from the context or product they currently see, not the product that you’re trying to build. It’s common for users to ask for features you should add. Whenever they do, it’s important as a product builder that you ask them questions back. What is the use case? What is the problem they’re trying to solve with this feature or solution? How would their experience of the product be different if the problem was fixed?

By pivoting the conversation away from a feature request and toward explaining the problem they are trying to solve, you move the discussion towards the pain point. In this conversation, you’ll learn whether the problem is valuable to solve or nice to have. It also allows you to explore multiple solutions to the problem, and to choose the right one within the context of your broader vision.

Build for the right users
You may also talk to users who have a lot of feedback but who aren’t in your target demographic or aren’t it now. If you think you are building for things for early-stage startups, listening to an enterprise customer will likely set you on the wrong path and it’s unlikely that they will even become a customer.

Incorporate the feedback and let it refine your product, but don’t let user feedback alone dictate what you build. You can become too reactive to user feedback. This is why it’s good to have strategic initiatives, that help you balance the needs of the users and the needs of the company.

### 3.5 Launch and keep launching

Source: https://linear.app/method/launching

There is a false belief there needs to be a singular moment for launch. This doesn’t have to be the case and a lot of times many startups launch multiple times. It usually works better than having one massive launch. The problem with massive launches is that it takes time to prepare and they are riskier. There is also an increased risk that the launch won’t work and all the work is wasted. By launching multiple times, you are building your story and brand over time and compounding people's interest. Each launch builds more following, which then helps your future launches.

Secondly, in the first months or years, your product is likely not a fit for everyone. It’s better to launch early and start getting users and momentum, than trying to wait for that perfect moment.

Similar to changelogs, launching keeps reminding the market that your company exists and you’re making progress.

For example, when we launched Linear we announced the company before we had the product built. We launched when we raised seed funding and evolved the product. We launched when we opened the product for everyone and added pricing. We launched when we did a Series A and evolved the product. Each of the launches reached more people and generated more customers than the previous ones. Had we only launched once, it would have taken us 1.5 years to get to this state and we wouldn’t have learned as much or have as many customers as we have today.

### 3.6 Build in public

Source: https://linear.app/method/build-in-public

It might feel dangerous to show what you’re building but often it’s more useful. If anything, your competition might be discouraged by your speed and either forced to copy you or avoid copying you.

One way to build in public is to publish a changelog. It might seem silly to summarize your work in a changelog when you don’t have many users, but we think it’s helpful. For you and the team, it reminds you every week what happened and encourages you to ship constantly. For users, it shows the product is getting better. For investors, it shows progress. At times, when you feel things not moving as fast, you can look back at how much you achieved already.

There are other reasons why the changelog can be useful. Read more: `@docs/Startups Write Changelogs`
